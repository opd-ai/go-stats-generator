# TASK: Select and Execute Single Roadmap Item

## OBJECTIVE:
You are a Go development agent tasked with selecting ONE specific task from the provided ROADMAP.md file and implementing it completely. Your implementation must prioritize simplicity, use existing libraries over custom solutions, and follow Go best practices for maintainable code.

## EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS:
First, analyze the ROADMAP.md to identify the highest-priority incomplete task (look for items marked as "TODO", "In Progress", or similar indicators). Select the task that appears most critical or has explicit priority markers. Once selected, implement the task using these constraints: (1) Prefer Go standard library over third-party packages when possible, (2) If external libraries are needed, choose well-maintained options with >1000 GitHub stars and recent activity, (3) Write functions under 30 lines with descriptive names, (4) Handle all errors explicitly with context, (5) Add comprehensive comments for any logic over 3 steps. Your implementation should include unit tests with table-driven test patterns where appropriate.

## COMPLETION CRITERIA:
After implementing the selected task, update the ROADMAP.md to mark the task as completed with today's date. Provide a brief implementation summary explaining: which task was selected and why, what libraries (if any) were used and why they were chosen over alternatives, and what files were created or modified. Ensure all code follows `gofmt` standards and includes proper package documentation. The implementation must be production-ready with appropriate error handling and must not break existing functionality in the codebase.
