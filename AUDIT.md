## DETAILED FINDINGS

~~~~
### ✅ RESOLVED: CSV Reporter Not Implemented Fixed
**File:** internal/reporter/json.go:58-63
**Severity:** High (RESOLVED)
**Description:** ~~The documentation advertises CSV output format in the README.md, and the CLI help shows this format as available option, but the actual implementation returned "not yet implemented" errors.~~ **FIXED:** CSV reporter now generates proper formatted output with comprehensive metrics.
**Resolution:** Implemented full CSV reporter functionality with sections for metadata, overview, functions, structs, and packages. Also implemented CSV diff reporting for baseline comparisons.
**Impact:** Users can now use CSV format for analysis output, enabling easy integration with spreadsheets and data processing tools.
**Validation:** Added comprehensive tests in `internal/reporter/csv_bug_test.go` that verify CSV generation works correctly
**Code Reference:**
```go
func (r *CSVReporter) Generate(report *metrics.Report, output io.Writer) error {
    writer := csv.NewWriter(output)
    defer writer.Flush()
    // Full implementation with metadata, overview, functions, structs, packages sections
}
```
**Note:** Markdown reporter was already working correctly; only CSV needed implementation.

### MISSING FEATURE: Design Pattern Detection Not Implemented
**File:** cmd/analyze.go:279-315
**Severity:** High
**Description:** The README.md prominently features "Advanced Pattern Detection: Design patterns, concurrency patterns, anti-patterns" but the analyze workflow only initializes empty pattern structures without actual detection logic.
**Expected Behavior:** Should detect Singleton, Factory, Builder, Observer, and Strategy patterns as documented
**Actual Behavior:** PatternMetrics structures are initialized with empty slices and never populated
**Impact:** Major advertised feature is completely non-functional
**Reproduction:** Analyze any codebase - patterns section will always be empty
**Code Reference:**
```go
Patterns: metrics.PatternMetrics{
    ConcurrencyPatterns: metrics.ConcurrencyPatternMetrics{
        WorkerPools: []metrics.PatternInstance{}, // Always empty
        Pipelines:   []metrics.PatternInstance{}, // Always empty
        // ... more empty slices
    },
},
```

### ✅ RESOLVED: Infinite Channel Reading Bug Fixed
**File:** cmd/analyze.go:488-515
**Severity:** High (RESOLVED)
**Description:** ~~The analysis workflow reads from a results channel in a for-range loop without proper channel closure handling, potentially causing goroutine leaks or hangs.~~ **FIXED:** Now uses proper context cancellation and select statement.
**Resolution:** Updated `processAnalysisResults` function to accept context parameter and use select statement with `case <-ctx.Done()` for proper timeout/cancellation handling
**Impact:** Analysis workflow now respects context timeouts and cancellation, preventing indefinite hangs
**Validation:** Added regression tests in `cmd/infinite_channel_bug_test.go` that verify context cancellation works correctly
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Fixed implementation with context handling
func processAnalysisResults(ctx context.Context, results <-chan scanner.Result, ...) {
    for {
        select {
        case result, ok := <-results:
            // Process results...
        case <-ctx.Done():
            return nil, nil, fmt.Errorf("analysis cancelled: %w", ctx.Err())
        }
    }
}
```

~~~~
### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Binary Name Inconsistency
**File:** cmd/root.go:17,87
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** The root command defines "Use: go-stats-generator" and the actual binary name and module name is "go-stats-generator", creating consistency in help text and documentation.
**Expected Behavior:** Help text should consistently use "go-stats-generator" as the command name
**Actual Behavior:** Help text shows "go-stats-generator" and binary is named "go-stats-generator"
**Impact:** User confusion when following documentation or help text
**Reproduction:** Run --help command and compare with actual binary name
**Code Reference:**
```go
var rootCmd = &cobra.Command{
    Use:   "go-stats-generator", // Now consistent
    Short: "Go Source Code Statistics Generator",
}
```

### MISSING FEATURE: Git Integration Functions Not Implemented
**File:** cmd/baseline.go:337-350
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** The baseline command includes metadata fields for Git branch and commit information, but the helper functions return empty strings with placeholder comments.
**Expected Behavior:** Should extract current Git branch and commit hash for baseline metadata
**Actual Behavior:** Always returns empty strings, losing valuable versioning context
**Impact:** Baseline snapshots lack important version control context for tracking changes
**Reproduction:** Create any baseline - Git fields will always be empty
**Code Reference:**
```go
func getCurrentBranch() string {
    // Try to get current git branch
    // This is a placeholder - in real implementation you'd use git commands
    return ""
}
```

### ✅ RESOLVED: Nesting Depth Calculation Bug Fixed
**File:** internal/analyzer/function.go:367-437
**Severity:** High (RESOLVED)
**Description:** ~~The calculateNestingDepth function increments currentDepth but never decrements it when exiting blocks, causing incorrect depth calculations.~~ **FIXED:** Now uses proper recursive approach to accurately track nesting depth.
**Resolution:** Replaced buggy ast.Inspect approach with recursive walkForNestingDepth function that correctly tracks depth for control flow structures (if, for, switch, select, etc.)
**Impact:** Nesting depth metrics are now accurate, improving complexity analysis reliability
**Validation:** Added comprehensive regression tests in `internal/analyzer/nesting_depth_bug_test.go`
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Fixed implementation uses proper recursive depth tracking
func (fa *FunctionAnalyzer) calculateNestingDepth(block *ast.BlockStmt) int {
	maxDepth := 0
	fa.walkForNestingDepth(block, 0, &maxDepth)
	return maxDepth
}
```

### EDGE CASE BUG: Line Classification Fails on Complex Comment Patterns
**File:** internal/analyzer/function.go:226-275
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** The classifyLine function doesn't handle nested block comments or escaped quote characters within comments, leading to misclassification of line types.
**Expected Behavior:** Should correctly classify lines with nested /* /* */ */ patterns and escaped characters
**Actual Behavior:** May misclassify complex comment patterns as code lines
**Impact:** Line counting metrics may be inaccurate for files with complex comment structures
**Reproduction:** Create file with nested block comments or comments containing /* patterns
**Code Reference:**
```go
blockStartIdx := strings.Index(line, "/*")
blockEndIdx := strings.Index(line[blockStartIdx:], "*/")
// Doesn't handle nested comments or escaped characters
```

~~~~
### MISSING FEATURE: Trend Analysis Commands Not Implemented
**File:** cmd/trend.go:42-50
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** The README.md documents trend analysis with examples like "go-stats-generator trend analyze --days 30" but the trend subcommands are defined without RunE implementations.
**Expected Behavior:** Should provide trend analysis, forecasting, and regression detection as documented
**Actual Behavior:** Trend commands are defined but have no implementation (RunE functions are not assigned)
**Impact:** Entire trend analysis functionality advertised in README is non-functional
**Reproduction:** Attempt to run any trend subcommand - will show help or fail
**Code Reference:**
```go
var trendAnalyzeCmd = &cobra.Command{
    Use:   "analyze",
    Short: "Analyze trends for specific metrics",
    Long:  "Analyze trends for specific metrics over a time period.",
    RunE:  runTrendAnalyze, // Function not implemented
}
```
~~~~

~~~~
### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Public API Limited Compared to CLI
**File:** pkg/go-stats-generator/api.go:32-130
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** The public API in pkg/go-stats-generator only implements basic function analysis, missing struct, interface, package, and concurrency analysis that the CLI provides.
**Expected Behavior:** Public API should provide same analysis capabilities as CLI tool
**Actual Behavior:** API only analyzes functions, ignoring most other metrics types
**Impact:** Library users cannot access full analysis capabilities programmatically
**Reproduction:** Use go_stats_generator.NewAnalyzer().AnalyzeDirectory() - only functions will be analyzed
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Only analyzes functions, missing:
// - structAnalyzer
// - interfaceAnalyzer  
// - packageAnalyzer
// - concurrencyAnalyzer
functions, err := functionAnalyzer.AnalyzeFunctions(result.File, result.FileInfo.Package)
```

### ✅ RESOLVED: File Discovery Bug Fixed
**File:** cmd/analyze.go:154-175
**Severity:** High (RESOLVED)
**Description:** ~~The analyze command checks file existence with os.Stat but doesn't verify if the target is a directory before passing to file discovery, potentially causing unexpected behavior.~~ **FIXED:** Now properly handles both files and directories.
**Resolution:** Updated analyze command to check `fileInfo.IsDir()` and call appropriate analysis functions for files vs directories
**Impact:** Analyze command now works correctly with both individual files and directories
**Validation:** Added regression tests in `cmd/file_discovery_bug_test.go` that verify both file and directory analysis work correctly
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Fixed implementation with proper file/directory handling
if fileInfo.IsDir() {
    report, err = runDirectoryAnalysis(ctx, absPath, cfg)
} else {
    report, err = runFileAnalysis(ctx, absPath, cfg)
}
```

~~~~
### EDGE CASE BUG: Memory Leak in Large File Processing
**File:** internal/analyzer/function.go:156-182
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** The countLinesInRange function reads entire source files into memory using os.ReadFile without size limits or streaming, potentially causing memory issues with very large files.
**Expected Behavior:** Should handle large files efficiently, possibly with streaming or size limits
**Actual Behavior:** Loads entire file content into memory regardless of size
**Impact:** Could cause out-of-memory errors when processing very large Go files
**Reproduction:** Process a Go file larger than available memory
**Code Reference:**
```go
src, err := os.ReadFile(file.Name()) // Loads entire file into memory
if err != nil {
    return metrics.LineMetrics{}
}
lines := strings.Split(string(src), "\n") // Creates another copy in memory
```
~~~~

~~~~
### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Storage Configuration Ignored in Implementation
**File:** cmd/baseline.go:97-103, internal/config/config.go:85-95
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** The configuration defines flexible storage options (sqlite, json, memory) with compression and retention settings, but baseline command hardcodes SQLite configuration.
**Expected Behavior:** Should respect storage configuration from config file or defaults
**Actual Behavior:** Always uses hardcoded SQLite settings regardless of configuration
**Impact:** Configuration options for storage are non-functional, limiting deployment flexibility
**Reproduction:** Set storage type to "json" in config - baseline will still use SQLite
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Hardcoded values ignore cfg.Storage settings
sqliteConfig := storage.SQLiteConfig{
    Path:              cfg.Storage.Path, // Only uses path
    EnableWAL:         true,             // Hardcoded
    MaxConnections:    10,               // Hardcoded
    EnableCompression: cfg.Storage.Compression,
}
```
