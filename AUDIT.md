## DETAILED FINDINGS

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: CSV and HTML Output Formats Not Implemented
**File:** cmd/analyze.go:89, internal/reporter/reporter.go
**Severity:** High
**Description:** The documentation advertises support for CSV, HTML, and Markdown output formats, but only console and JSON formatters are implemented. CSV format falls back to console output.
**Expected Behavior:** Should generate properly formatted CSV, HTML, and Markdown reports as documented
**Actual Behavior:** CSV, HTML, and Markdown formats all produce console output instead of their respective formats
**Impact:** Users cannot generate reports in documented formats, breaking automated workflows that depend on specific output formats
**Reproduction:** Run `go-stats-generator analyze . --format csv` or `--format html` - produces console output instead
**Code Reference:**
```go
switch cfg.Output.Format {
case config.FormatJSON:
    rep = reporter.NewJSONReporter()
case config.FormatConsole:
    fallthrough
default:
    rep = reporter.NewConsoleReporter(&cfg.Output)
}
```

### MISSING FEATURE: Pattern Detection Not Implemented
**File:** internal/analyzer/, internal/metrics/types.go:686
**Severity:** High
**Description:** Documentation promises "Advanced Pattern Detection" including design patterns, concurrency patterns, and anti-patterns, but no pattern detection logic exists in the analyzer package.
**Expected Behavior:** Should detect and report various Go design patterns, concurrency patterns, and anti-patterns as shown in JSON output structure
**Actual Behavior:** Pattern detection fields in JSON output are always null/empty, no pattern analysis performed
**Impact:** Major documented feature completely missing, significantly reducing the tool's analytical value
**Reproduction:** Run analysis with `--include-patterns` flag - patterns section in JSON is empty
**Code Reference:**
```go
"patterns": {
  "design_patterns": {
    "singleton": null,
    "factory": null,
    // ... all patterns are null
  }
}
```

### CRITICAL BUG: Incorrect Baseline Diff Command Interface  
**File:** cmd/diff.go:28-35
**Severity:** High
**Description:** Documentation shows diff command with `--baseline` and `--current` flags, but actual implementation expects two positional arguments for report files instead.
**Expected Behavior:** `go-stats-generator diff --baseline "v1.0.0" --current .` should compare baseline with current directory
**Actual Behavior:** Command expects `go-stats-generator diff [baseline-report] [comparison-report]` and rejects --baseline flag
**Impact:** Documented baseline comparison workflow is completely broken, users cannot use the advertised diff functionality
**Reproduction:** Run `go-stats-generator diff --baseline "test-baseline" --current .` - returns "unknown flag: --baseline"
**Code Reference:**
```go
var diffCmd = &cobra.Command{
    Use:   "diff [baseline-report] [comparison-report] [flags]",
    // Missing --baseline and --current flag definitions
}
```

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Struct and Interface Analysis Missing
**File:** pkg/gostats/api.go:87-89, internal/analyzer/
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** Documentation promises detailed struct and interface analysis with complexity metrics, but no struct or interface analyzers exist. JSON output shows structs/interfaces as null.
**Expected Behavior:** Should analyze struct complexity, field types, embedded types, interface methods as documented
**Actual Behavior:** Struct and interface analysis is completely missing from implementation
**Impact:** Significant reduction in analysis capabilities, missing major components of code quality assessment
**Reproduction:** Analyze code with structs/interfaces - they don't appear in the report
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Only function analysis is implemented
functions, err := functionAnalyzer.AnalyzeFunctions(result.File, result.FileInfo.Package)
// No struct or interface analysis calls
```

### MISSING FEATURE: Line Counting Algorithm Inaccurate
**File:** cmd/analyze.go:323-324
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** Documentation promises "precise line counting" excluding comments and blank lines, but implementation uses a rough file size estimation.
**Expected Behavior:** Should parse AST and count actual code lines, excluding comments and blank lines as documented
**Actual Behavior:** Uses crude estimation: `totalLines += int(result.FileInfo.Size) / 50`
**Impact:** Line count metrics are completely inaccurate, undermining reliability of all line-based analysis
**Reproduction:** Compare reported line counts with actual file line counts - significant discrepancies
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Count lines (simplified)
totalLines += int(result.FileInfo.Size) / 50 // Rough estimate
```

### MISSING FEATURE: Trend Analysis Command Incomplete
**File:** cmd/trend.go
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** Documentation shows rich trend analysis with forecasting capabilities, but trend command only has basic structure without full implementation.
**Expected Behavior:** Should provide statistical analysis, forecasting, and visual trend data
**Actual Behavior:** Trend analysis command exists but lacks sophisticated analysis capabilities shown in documentation
**Impact:** Advanced historical analysis features are not available as advertised
**Reproduction:** Run `go-stats-generator trend analyze --days 30` - minimal functionality compared to documentation promises
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Basic trend command structure exists but lacks advanced statistical analysis
```

### EDGE CASE BUG: Progress Display Mixed with Output
**File:** cmd/analyze.go:260-264
**Severity:** Low
**Description:** Progress reporting writes to stderr and can interfere with formatted output, especially when redirecting stdout.
**Expected Behavior:** Progress should be cleanly separated from report output
**Actual Behavior:** Progress output can appear mixed with report data in certain terminal configurations
**Impact:** Can corrupt output parsing in automated workflows
**Reproduction:** Run with progress enabled and redirect output - progress markers may appear in output
**Code Reference:**
```go
progressCallback = func(completed, total int) {
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "\rProcessing files: %d/%d (%.1f%%)",
        completed, total, float64(completed)/float64(total)*100)
}
```

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Performance Metrics Not Tracked
**File:** internal/metrics/types.go, cmd/analyze.go
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** Documentation promises performance optimization and tracking for "enterprise scale" with specific benchmarks, but no performance metrics are collected or reported.
**Expected Behavior:** Should track and report memory usage, processing speed, and other performance metrics as documented in benchmarks section
**Actual Behavior:** Only basic analysis time is tracked, no memory usage or detailed performance metrics
**Impact:** Cannot verify performance claims or optimize for large codebases as advertised
**Reproduction:** Run analysis and check output - only analysis time is reported, no memory or detailed performance data
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Only basic timing tracked
report.Metadata.AnalysisTime = time.Since(startTime)
// No memory usage, throughput, or other performance metrics
```

### CRITICAL BUG: Generic Analysis Not Implemented
**File:** internal/analyzer/, internal/metrics/types.go:580-700
**Severity:** High
**Description:** Documentation advertises "Generic usage analysis (Go 1.18+)" as a key feature, but no generic analysis logic exists in the analyzer.
**Expected Behavior:** Should analyze generic type parameters, constraints, instantiations as defined in metrics structure
**Actual Behavior:** Generic analysis fields are always zero/null, no actual generic analysis performed
**Impact:** Advertised modern Go feature analysis is completely missing
**Reproduction:** Analyze code with generics - generics section in JSON output shows zero values
**Code Reference:**
```go
"generics": {
  "type_parameters": {"count": 0, "constraints": null},
  "instantiations": {"functions": null, "types": null},
  // All fields are empty/zero
}
```

### MISSING FEATURE: Documentation Quality Analysis Incomplete
**File:** internal/analyzer/function.go:350-355
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** Documentation quality analysis exists but lacks depth promised in documentation, such as example detection and sophisticated quality scoring.
**Expected Behavior:** Should provide comprehensive documentation analysis with example detection and quality metrics
**Actual Behavior:** Basic comment length tracking only, missing example detection and sophisticated quality assessment
**Impact:** Documentation quality insights are superficial compared to advertised capabilities
**Reproduction:** Analyze code with examples in comments - example detection is not performed
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Basic documentation tracking only
DocumentationInfo struct {
    HasComment    bool    `json:"has_comment"`
    CommentLength int     `json:"comment_length"`
    HasExample    bool    `json:"has_example"` // Not actually implemented
    QualityScore  float64 `json:"quality_score"` // Basic calculation only
}
```

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Configuration File Support Incomplete
**File:** cmd/root.go:70-85, internal/config/config.go
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** Documentation shows detailed YAML configuration with many options, but actual configuration loading and application is incomplete for many settings.
**Expected Behavior:** Should load and apply all configuration options from .go-stats-generator.yaml as documented
**Actual Behavior:** Configuration file is loaded but many options are not actually applied to analysis behavior
**Impact:** Users cannot customize analysis behavior as advertised through configuration files
**Reproduction:** Create .go-stats-generator.yaml with various settings - many have no effect on analysis output
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Configuration is loaded but not fully applied
if err := viper.ReadInConfig(); err == nil && verbose {
    fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, "Using config file:", viper.ConfigFileUsed())
}
// Missing application of many config options to analysis workflow
```

### CRITICAL BUG: Worker Pool Configuration Not Applied
**File:** cmd/analyze.go:235-240, internal/scanner/worker.go
**Severity:** High  
**Description:** Documentation advertises configurable concurrency with worker pools, but worker count configuration from flags/config is not properly applied to the worker pool.
**Expected Behavior:** Should respect --workers flag and configuration file worker_count setting
**Actual Behavior:** Worker pool may not use specified worker count, defaulting to internal logic
**Impact:** Performance tuning capabilities are not functional as advertised
**Reproduction:** Run with `--workers 1` and `--workers 16` - processing behavior may not change as expected
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Worker pool created but configuration may not be properly applied
workerPool := scanner.NewWorkerPool(&cfg.Performance, discoverer)
// Need to verify if cfg.Performance.WorkerCount is actually used
```

### PERFORMANCE ISSUE: Memory Usage Not Optimized for Large Codebases
**File:** internal/scanner/worker.go, cmd/analyze.go:300-330
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** Documentation claims "<1GB memory usage" for large repositories, but implementation loads all analysis results into memory simultaneously without streaming.
**Expected Behavior:** Should process files in batches to maintain low memory usage as advertised
**Actual Behavior:** All analysis results accumulated in memory, potentially exceeding memory limits for large codebases
**Impact:** May not meet documented performance characteristics for enterprise-scale repositories
**Reproduction:** Analyze a large codebase - memory usage may exceed advertised limits
**Code Reference:**
```go
// All results accumulated in memory
var allFunctions []metrics.FunctionMetrics
for result := range results {
    functions, err := analyzer.AnalyzeFunctions(result.File, result.FileInfo.Package)
    allFunctions = append(allFunctions, functions...) // Continuous accumulation
}
```

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Exit Codes for CI/CD Integration Missing
**File:** cmd/analyze.go, cmd/root.go
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** Documentation promises "CI/CD Integration" with exit codes for automated quality gates, but no quality threshold checking or appropriate exit codes are implemented.
**Expected Behavior:** Should exit with non-zero code when quality thresholds are exceeded for CI/CD integration
**Actual Behavior:** Always exits with code 0 unless there's an error, no quality gate functionality
**Impact:** Cannot be used in automated quality gates as advertised for CI/CD workflows
**Reproduction:** Analyze code that exceeds complexity thresholds - exit code is always 0
**Code Reference:**
```go
// No quality gate logic or exit code setting based on thresholds
func runAnalyze(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
    // Analysis runs but no threshold checking for exit codes
    return nil // Always returns success
}
```
