    - **Dependencies**: Steps 1-12
    - **Metric Justification**: Documentation coverage currently 31.8% for packages, target ≥50%

## Technical Specifications

- **Refactoring Pattern**: Extract method — break down complex functions into smaller, focused helpers with single responsibilities
- **Map-based Dispatch**: For switch/case statements with >5 cases (e.g., FilterReportSections), use `map[string]func()` pattern to reduce cyclomatic complexity
- **Visitor Pattern**: For AST traversal functions (walkForNestingDepth, extractNestedBlocks), implement typed visitor interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Preserve existing error propagation; do not change function signatures during refactoring
- **Test Coverage**: All refactoring must pass existing tests; no new test failures allowed
- **Naming Convention**: Helper functions use descriptive verb-noun names (e.g., `handleIfStatement`, `filterBySection`)

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] `go-stats-generator analyze . --skip-tests --sections functions | grep -c "complexity.*>[0-9]\{2\}"` returns 0 for production code
- [ ] Zero functions in `internal/` and `cmd/` with cyclomatic complexity >10.0
- [ ] `go test ./...` passes with no new failures
- [ ] `go-stats-generator diff baseline.json post-refactor.json` shows complexity reductions, no regressions in other metrics
- [ ] Package documentation coverage ≥50% (up from 31.8%)
- [ ] All refactored functions have GoDoc comments explaining their purpose

## Known Gaps

- **ARIMA Forecasting**: README.md promises ARIMA/exponential smoothing but this is deferred — linear regression covers 80% of use cases
- **Trend Placeholder Commands**: `trend forecast` and `trend regressions` remain placeholders — separate phase (see GAPS.md Gap 1)
- **High Duplication Ratio**: 47% duplication inflated by testdata — recommend `--exclude testdata` for accurate production metrics
- **Annotation Resolution**: 1 TODO, 1 FIXME, 1 HACK, 1 BUG in `internal/metrics/types.go` — not blocking this phase
