# TASK: Execute Next Planned Item for Go Project #codebase

## OBJECTIVE:
Review PLAN.md or ROADMAP.md to identify the first unfinished task and implement it following Go best practices with comprehensive testing and documentation. Execute exactly one task with no regressions.

## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

### Code Standards:
- Use standard library first, then well-maintained libraries (>1000 GitHub stars, updated within 6 months)
- Keep functions under 30 lines with single responsibility
- Handle all errors explicitly - no ignored error returns
- Write self-documenting code with descriptive names over abbreviations

### Execution Process:
1. **Analysis**: Read PLAN.md or ROADMAP.md and identify the first incomplete item with clear acceptance criteria
2. **Design**: Before coding, document your approach and library choices in comments
3. **Implementation**: Write the minimal viable solution using existing libraries where possible
4. **Testing**: Create unit tests with >80% coverage for business logic, include error case testing
5. **Documentation**: Add GoDoc comments for exported functions and update README if needed
6. **Reporting**: Update PLAN.md or ROADMAP.md to reflect the updates and changes.

### Validation Checklist:
- [ ] Solution uses existing libraries instead of custom implementations
- [ ] All error paths tested and handled
- [ ] Code readable by junior developers without extensive context
- [ ] Tests demonstrate both success and failure scenarios
- [ ] Documentation explains WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT
- [ ] PLAN.md or ROADMAP.md is up-to-date

**SIMPLICITY RULE**: If your solution requires more than 3 levels of abstraction or clever patterns, redesign it for clarity. Choose boring, maintainable solutions over elegant complexity.
