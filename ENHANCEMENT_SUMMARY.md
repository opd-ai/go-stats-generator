- **Environment Integration**: Support for multiple storage backends and settings

## New CLI Commands

### Baseline Management
```bash
# Create baseline snapshots
go-stats-generator baseline create [path] --id "v1.0.0" --message "Initial baseline"

# List all baselines
go-stats-generator baseline list

# Delete specific baseline
go-stats-generator baseline delete "baseline-id"
```

### Complexity Differential Analysis
```bash
# Compare with baseline (conceptual - implementation pending completion)
go-stats-generator diff baseline-report.json current-report.json

# Traditional file-based comparison (current implementation)
go-stats-generator diff baseline-report.json current-report.json
```

### Trend Analysis
```bash
# Analyze trends over time
go-stats-generator trend analyze --days 30 --metric complexity

# Generate forecasts
go-stats-generator trend forecast --days 60

# Detect regressions
go-stats-generator trend regressions --threshold 10.0
```
